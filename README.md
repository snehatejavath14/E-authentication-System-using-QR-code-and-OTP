# E-authentication-System-using-QR-code-and-OTP
A secure authentication system using QR Code and OTP for validating user identity. The system generates a QR code which is scanned by the user, followed by an OTP verification to ensure secure login access. This project enhances security and avoids traditional password-based attacks.
